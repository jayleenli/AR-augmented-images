# AR Augmented Images in Android

Just playing around with ARCore and Android using bits of the starter ARCore sample for augmented images. 

Start up the app and uses these two images to see the two models that I loaded for augmented images. If the augmented images are close enough to each other there will be a collision message logged in the console.   

I want to expand on this further in a future hackathon as this hackathon was really just to learn more about mobile/Android development and AR - two things I'm super inexperienced in. ðŸ˜ƒ

#### Lessons learned 
Unity is kinda hard :'), but if definitely better for AR  
Finding an image that will work well for augmented images is hard, I guess ARCore really like pictures of the earth
